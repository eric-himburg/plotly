# Plotly - Belly Button Biodiversity
## Overview of the Project
An interactive website was created using a combination of html, javascript, and bootstrap css stylizing.  Additionally, the Plotly library was accessed through a CDN and used to generate three different graphic visuals on the site: a bar chart, a gauge, and a bubble chart.  The point of the web site is to analyze the types of bacteria growing in different anonymous test subjects belly buttons.  The completed web site can be viewed at the link below.

## Enhancing the Website using Bootstrap
Bootstrap web frame-working was used to ensure the web site could be viewed from any device and was also used to make the content more readable.  Below is a screenshot of some the styling done to color the background, add a border color, and also add a picture.
